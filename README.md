### Blockchain-based Decentralized Application (DApp) in Java

This project provides a basic implementation of a Blockchain-based Decentralized Application (DApp) in Java. The project consists of two main parts: the Blockchain implementation and the Decentralized Application skeleton.

### Blockchain Implementation:

The `Blockchain` class represents the blockchain data structure, which is a linked list of blocks. Each block contains data, a timestamp, the hash of the previous block, and its own hash. The `Block` class represents an individual block in the blockchain.

### Decentralized Application (DApp) Skeleton:

The `DecentralizedApp` class serves as the entry point for the decentralized application. It initializes the blockchain and demonstrates basic operations such as adding blocks to the blockchain and checking the validity of the blockchain.

### Usage:

To run the application, simply execute the `main` method in the `DecentralizedApp` class. This will demonstrate the basic functionality of the blockchain and the decentralized application.

Note: This is a simplified implementation for educational purposes. Real-world decentralized applications would involve more complexity and additional features.
